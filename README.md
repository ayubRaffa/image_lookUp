due to the short duration of the test and the shortage of time, i was unable the host the project to the internet 
however the site well be publicly available any time soon :) 

after installing all the dependancies on the server and client folders,
you can run "npm run dev" on the server folder and "npm start" on the client folder" for the 
project to run
